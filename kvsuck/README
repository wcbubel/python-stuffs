kvsuck is a sucky Key Value Store and crappy ReST API.
It uses sqlite as the backend database.


DO NOT USE THIS CODE. EVER. SERIOUSLY, DON'T.


ReST API:

  Post a value:
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/key?value=val

  Get a value:
    curl http://localhost:8080/key

  Update a value:
    curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/key?value=val

  Delete a value
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/key

Database:
  Stored as kvsuck.db in the same working directory as where
  you launched kvsuck.py


I TOLD YOU NOT TO USE IT BRO.
